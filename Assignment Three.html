<p style="font-family: arial; font-size:19px ; padding-left: 60px;">
When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought <br>
me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has <br>
given me a unique learning experience.

 At five, I <a href="https://facebook.com" style="color: blue;"> marveled</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the <br>
heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways <br>
 on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and <br>

thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in <br>
<a href="https://starzit.com" style="color: blue;">Starz University</a>.

It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first <br>
became interested in language.
</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size:19px ; padding-left: 60px;" >
It began with French, which taught me the importance of <br> 
pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris <br> 
where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it <br>
PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on <br>
the A, she looked at me bewildered.

In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and <br>
aware of its similarities  with English through cognates.<br>
Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks <br>
different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to <br>
me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates <br> 
come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. <a href="mailto:josephbrooks938@gmail.com" style="color: blue;">Send Us Email</a>

Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my<br> 
school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I<br> 
loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning<br>
fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means<br>
volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty<br> 
and rhythm as I form them.
